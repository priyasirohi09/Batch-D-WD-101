# üñ•Ô∏è Guide to Building Your Personal Portfolio Website
## DEADLINE - 10th October, 2025
## 1. Planning Before You Code

* **Define Purpose**: Your portfolio should showcase *you*. Ask yourself:

  * Who is my target audience? (recruiters, peers, faculty, industry mentors)
  * What do I want them to see first? (skills, projects, achievements)
* **Sketch Layout**: Draw a rough wireframe on paper for homepage, about, projects, contact.

---

## 2. Structure of the Portfolio

A good portfolio usually has these sections:

1. **Header / Navigation**

   * Name / Logo on the left.
   * Navigation links: *Home, About, Projects, Contact*.
   * Responsive navbar (hamburger menu for mobile).

2. **Hero Section**

   * A short introduction with your name, role (e.g., *‚ÄúFrontend Developer‚Äù*).
   * A clean background or hero image.
   * A ‚ÄúCall-to-Action‚Äù button like *Download Resume* or *View My Work*.

3. **About Me**

   * A professional photo (optional).
   * Short bio (who you are, what you do, interests).
   * Highlight your skills in a visually clear way (lists, icons, or progress bars).

4. **Projects / Work Showcase**

   * Cards or grid layout with project screenshots.
   * Each card: project title, short description, tech stack, link to GitHub / live demo.

5. **Contact Section**

   * Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, social links.
   * A simple contact form (optional, just HTML + CSS layout if not connecting backend).

6. **Footer**

   * Minimal design with copyright info.
   * Quick links or social media icons.

## 3. HTML Guidelines

* Use **semantic HTML**: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`.
* Maintain proper **nesting** and indentation for readability.
* Use **alt text** for all images (good for accessibility).
* Keep content organized using `<div>` only when necessary.

---

## 4. CSS Guidelines

* **Responsive Design**

  * Use `flexbox` or `grid` for layout.
  * Add `@media` queries for mobile responsiveness.
* **Typography**

  * Stick to 2‚Äì3 fonts max (Google Fonts can help).
  * Maintain clear hierarchy with headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) and paragraph styles.
* **Color Theory**

  * Choose a consistent color palette (2‚Äì3 main colors).
  * Ensure **contrast** (text must be readable).
* **Spacing**

  * Use consistent padding & margins.
  * Apply `line-height` for better readability.
* **Hover Effects**

  * Add subtle animations for buttons, links, and project cards.

---

## 5. Extra Enhancements

* **Favicon**: Small icon in the browser tab.
* **Animations**: Use CSS transitions for smooth effects.

## 6. Things to Avoid üö´

* Overuse of too many fonts or colors.
* Large unoptimized images that slow the site.
